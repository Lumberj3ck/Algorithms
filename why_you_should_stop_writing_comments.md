1. If your comment explains what your code does it is most of the time bad comment
    (Try refactor your code and for example, move expressions into variables with meaningful names,
    which can express themselves without your help) 
    If your if statement is big enough move it, into a function
    Use aliases instead of bare values
    If your code is needs a comments there is probably some issue with your code
2. Use code documentations which explains not how code is work, but how to use code
3. Use types instead of comments
