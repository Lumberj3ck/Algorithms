Array list is a DS which underneath the hood is using 
arrays.


It has bunch of methods 

Stack like methods

### Push and Pop, 
array list is good at push and pop 
Just check the capacity of the array if it's not enough
What happens when we exceed the capacity of the array
Create new array the copy all the values, push our new value

### Pop O(1)
So Append is light operation and pop(-1) is also light  almost O(1) operation


### Enqueue ( Insert(0) -- O(n) - because it depends on the legth of array ) 
For this when we exceed our array capacity 
we recreate array than, because we adding new value to the front of array
we need to shift values to the next position 
Insert almost at the end of list is lighter than inserting at the begining 
( we need to shift much less objects )


### Dequeue  ( Pop(0)  -- O(n) - because it depends on the legth of array )
Is the same. We need to shift over all values. 
remove the element from the middle of array is also O(n)


So this is why people use Python Deque ( Double linked queue )
Because it's very efficent to use when we poping and inserting values from 
the edges.
